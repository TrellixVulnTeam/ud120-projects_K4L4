# Facial Keypoint Detection

## Project Overview

In this project, knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures are used to build a facial keypoint detection system. 
Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. 
These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition.

The project will be broken up into a few main parts in four Python notebooks, **only Notebooks 2 and 3 (and the `models.py` file) will be graded**:


__Notebook 2__ : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints

__Notebook 3__ : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and your Trained CNN
